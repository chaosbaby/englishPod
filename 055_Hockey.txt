A: Hello everyone! I'm Rick Fields, and here with me is Bob Copeland.
B: Howdy folks, and welcome to today's game! You know, Rick, today is a key game between Russia and Canada. As you know, the winner  will move on to the finals.
A: That's right, and it looks like we're just about ready to start the match. The ref is calling the players for the face-off..., and here we go! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack! Federov gets checked hard into the boards!
B: Maurice Richard has the puck now, and passes it to the center. He shoots! Wow what a save by the goalie!
A: Alright, the puck is back in play now. Pavel Bure is on a breakaway! He is flying down the ice! The defenders can't keep up! Slap shot! He scores.
B: What an amazing goal!
