A: ... Right away sir, your order will be ready shortly, Jean Pierre, we have another special for table seven!
B: I'm working as fast as I can! We're really in the weeds! Where is my sous chef? Luc! I need you to peel more potatoes, Marie, chop some onions and carrots for the stew.
A: Jean Pierre another special! We're really packed tonight! We're running low on wine. Is there any left in the cellar?
C: Sorry I'm late, everyone. Wow, we are doing really well tonight!
B: Harry, stop talking and get over here I need this sauce stirred and the fish needs to be butchered and buttered.
C: OK, I'm on it!
A: Jean Pierre, table seven has requested to see the chef! I think they are food critics from Cuisine Magazine.
