A: Hi there, can I help you folks?
B: I'm just browsing; seeing what's on the lot. My daughter wants a car for her birthday, you know how it is.
C: Dad! I'm sixteen already and I'm, like, the only one at school who doesn't have a car!
A: She is right, you know. Kids these days all have cars. Let me show you something we just got in; a 1996 sedan.
Excellent gas millage, it has dual airbags and anti lock brakes; a perfect vehicle for a young driver.
C: Dad, I love it! It's awesome! Can we get this one please?
B: I see... What can you tell me about this one?
A: Oh, that's just an old World War Two tank that we use for TV commercials. Now about this sedan...
B: Whoa, whoa wait a minute. Tell me more about this tank.
A: Well, sir, if you are looking for quality and safety then look no further! Three inches of reinforced steel protect your daughter from short range missile attacks.
B: Does the sedan protect her from missile attacks?
A: It does not.
B: Well, I don't know. Let me sleep on it.
A: Did I mention the tank is a tank?
B: I'll take it!
C: Dad!
