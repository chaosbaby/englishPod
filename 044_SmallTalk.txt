A: morning.
B: Hi there Mr. Anderson! How are you on the fine morning？
A: fine, thank you.
B: It sure is cold this morning, isn't it? I barely even get out of bed!
A: Yeah. It's pretty cold, alright.
B: Did you catch the news this morning? I heard that there was a fire on Byron Street.
A: No, I didn't hear about that.
B: Did you happen to watch the football game last night? The Patriots scored in the last minute!
A: No, I didn't like football.
B: Oh... By the way, I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party. She is really beautiful!
A: She's my wife! Oh, here's my floor! Nice talking to you. Goodbye。
B: Sir this is the 56th floor! We are on the 70th!
A: That's okay, I'll take the stairs!
