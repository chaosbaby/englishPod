A: We've been over this a thousand times. The data is irrefutable! Look, we've done extensive research, built studies, and read the literature, and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory!

A: That is preposterous!
B: You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world's greatest mysteries, and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong!
A: I am not wrong! The chicken came first!
B: No! The egg came first!
