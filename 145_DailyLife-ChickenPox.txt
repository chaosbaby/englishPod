A: What's wrong with you? Why are you scratching so much?
B: I feel itchy! I can't stand it anymore! I think I am coming down with something. I feel lightheaded and weak.
A: Let me have a look. Whoa! Get away from me!
B: What's wrong?
A: I think you have chicken pox! You are contagious! Get away! Don't breathe on me!
B: Maybe it's just a rash or an allergy! We can't be sure until I see a doctor.
A: Well in the meantime you are a biohazard! I didn't get it when I was a kid and I've heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult!
B: Are you sure? You always blow things out of proportion. In any case, I think I'll take a oatmeal bath.
A: Ewww!
