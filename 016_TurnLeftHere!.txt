A: Hurry up, get in.
B: I'm in, let's go!
A: OKï¼Œ make a left here... No wait, I meant make a right. Come on, speed up!
B: Geez! What's the rush?
A: Don't worry about it, just drive. Oh, no, the light is about to change... Step on it!
B: Are you nuts! I'm not going to run a red light!
A: Whatever. Just turn right here ... The freeway will be packed at this hour ... Let's take a side street. Go on! Get out of our way! Move, move!
B: What's your problem! Geez. Having a fit is not going to help!
A: here, I know a short cut... Just go down here, and we'll cut though Ashburn Heights. Let's go, let's go! Watch out for that lady!
B: I'm going as fast as I can!
A: Yes! We made it. 5:58, just before the library closes.
B: You're such a geek!
