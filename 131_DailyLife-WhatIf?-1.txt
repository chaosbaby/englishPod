A: Okay, next question. If Eric asked you out on a date, what would you say?
B: Duh! I would say yes! Eric is the most popular kid in school! Okay, my turn. What would you do if you won the lottery?
A: Let's see... If I won the lottery, I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world.
B: If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure!
A: My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that!
B: Alright this is a good one. What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married?
A: If I told her that, she would faint and have me committed!
