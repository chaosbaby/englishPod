A: Hey man... I really like your pad. Those lamps are far out! Thanks for letting me crash here tonight.
B: It's no problem, brother! I wanted a pad where people could come, listen to music and just hang loose, you dig what's I'm saying?
A: I dig it man! We could throw a bash here and make it a really happening scene!
B: Yeah man, that would be groovy! Hey, I gotta split for a while, are you OK here by yourself?
A: Don't worry about me brother... You go take care of business.
B: Aright, peace out.
