A: Valerie! Hi! Wow how are you? It's been such a long time!
B: Darlene! Indeed, it's been a while! How have you been? Wow, you look amazing! I love what you've done to you hair!
A: Really? Thanks! I went to that hair salon that you told me about, but enough about me! Look at you! You haven't age a day since the last time I saw you! What is your secret!
A: Ha ha, come on! Well, I've been watching what I eat, and working out three times a week. By the way, I heard your son recently graduated!
A: Yes, my little Paul is finally a doctor. They grow up so fast you know.
B: He is such a handsome guy. He gets his look from his mother of course!
A: Thank you! What about your daughter, Pamela? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently.
B: Oh yes. She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended.
A: Such a lovely girl. I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday!
B: But of course! Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.
A: Same here! Well will catch up soon, maybe over coffee!
B: That would be great! Give me a call!
A: See you soon! Bye! Ugg... I can't stand that woman or her obnoxious son.
