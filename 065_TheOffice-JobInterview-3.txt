A: Very good. Now, I have a couple of final questions.
B: I hope they're not hard!
A: Well, why should we hire you?
B: I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company. I have a unique combination of strong acumen, and outstanding soft skills; you know, I excel at building strong, long-term customer relationships. For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team solved about seventy percent of our customer's problems. I decide that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products, so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department, we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers' issues. Give the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.
A: impressive! So, what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?
B: To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management. Punctuality has never been a strength of mine. I find it hard to organize my time efficiently. I have actually addressed this weakness recently, by attending a workshop on efficient time management. It helped me a lot, by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently, so I think I'm getting better now.
A: Great... Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview. We are short-listing our candidates this week, and next week we will inform our short listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO.
B: Great, thanks a lot! I hope to hear from you! Good bye.
