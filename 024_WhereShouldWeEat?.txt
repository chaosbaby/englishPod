A: Do you two have any plan for the evening?
B: We were thinking of checking a restaurant in the neighborhood. Do you have any suggestions?
A: I know this really nice Italian place. The food is fantastic, and the decorate is beautiful. I'd recommend giving it a try.
B: Actually, I'm not all that crazy about Italian food; I'm in the mood for something a bit lighter.
A: In that case, I know a great little bistro. They make a really tasty seafood platter; the fish is outstanding.
B: It sounds fantastic, but I'm allergic to seafood, so...
A: Okay, well, let me think... Oh, I know this great little place. It's just a hole in the wall, but they do the most amazing sandwiches. You gotta give them a try.
C: Ella, you took me there last time I visited, and I got food poisoning, remember?
