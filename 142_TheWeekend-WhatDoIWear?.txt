A: Honey come on! We are going to be late! Honestly, you take longer ready than I do!
B: I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt! Can you come here for a sec? I need your help.
A: What is it? Why are all these clothes on the bed?
B: I don't know what to wear! OK, give me your opinion. Do you like the way this looks? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals. I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I'll wear these as well.
A: Are you joking? What am I going to do with you? We are going to a dinner party not the beach! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and there corduroy pants. It's chilly outside so you can wear this coat.
B: Thanks honey! You have such great fashion sense. Now, What am I going to do with my hair?
