A: Honey, of course I forgive you! I love you so much! I've really missed you. I was wrong to get upset over nothing.
B: I'm sorry I haven't called or anything, but right after you decided you wanted a break, I was called up north to put out some major forest fires! I was in the middle of nowhere, working day and night, trying to prevent the blaze from spreading! It was pretty intense.
A: Oh, honey, I'm glad you're okay! But I have some exciting news... I think I'm pregnant!
B: Really? Wow, that's amazing! This is a great news! I've always wanted to be a father! We'll go to the doctor first thing in the morning!
C: We have test results back and , indeed, you are pregnant. Let's see here... Everything seems to be in order.
Your approximate due date is October twenty-seventy two thousand and nine, so that means that the baby was conceived on February third, two thousand and nine.
B: Are you sure? Are there things accurate?
C: Well, yes sir, they are.
A: What's wrong? Why are you asking these questions?
B: This baby isn't mine! I was away the first week of February at a training seminar!
A: I... I... No, it can't be...
