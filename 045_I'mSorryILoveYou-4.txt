A: ..., so, I said, "let's take a break." And since that night, I've waiting for him to call, but I still haven't heard from him. You don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?
B: Come on, don't be so dramatic! I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.
A: You think so? Oh, no! How can he do this to me? I'm sure he's cheating on me! Why else wouldn't he call?
B: But, you two are on a break. Theoretically he can do whatever he likes.
A: He's the love of my life! I've really messed this up.
B: Come on, hon. Pull yourself together. It's going to be alright.
A: But I ... I still love him! And it's all my fault! I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being. I mean, he is a firefighter, it's not like he can leave someone in the burning building and meet me for dinner. I've totally mess this up!
B: You know what, Veronica, I think you should make the first step. I'm sure he'll forgive you...
A: No, this is not gonna happen! I... I've ruin everything...
B: Hey... do you hear something? Guess what? It's your lovely firefighter!
C: When I had you, I treated you bad and wrong dear. And since, since you went away, don't you know I sit around with my head hanging down and I wonder who's loving you.
