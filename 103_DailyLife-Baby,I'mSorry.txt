A: Can we talk?
B: Sure, honey, we're talking now, aren't we?
A: You know what I mean.
B: Yeah, I know.

B: You know, I think you're awesome.
A: I'm awesome. Well, I guess that my answer, isn't it?
B: Honey...
A: Look, if you don't love me, it's not a thing, alright, we've had our laugh, but I don't appreciate... Maybe it's just time we...
B: Baby, I love you so much.
A: You do?
B: I love you. And I think you're awesome.
A: Oh, I love you too!
B: Come on. Put the gun down.
A: Oh baby, I'm so sorry.
