A: Welcome back, boxing fans! My name is Rick Field, and here with me is the man with an iron jaw, Bob Copeland.
B: Thank you, Rick! We are coming to you live from Las Vegas! We're in the beautiful NGM Grand Hotel and Casino where the world heavy weight championship is about to get under way!
A: That's right Bob! We are about to witness the legendary Italian Stallion himself, Rocky Balboa, square off against this lifetime rival, Apollo Creed! This will be a gruesome match for sure.
B: Both fighters are in the ring, and we are about to begin.
C: In the blue corner, weighing in at two hundred and twenty pounds, the former heavyweight champion of the world, "The Master of Disaster", the one and only, Apollo Creed! In the red corner, weighing two hundred and eighteen pounds and with a record of forty-seven wins and thirty-seven knockouts, the undefeated, undisputed, heavyweight champion of the world, the "Italian Stallion" Rocky Balboa!
A: There is the bell and this fight is underway! Apollo quickly attacks Rocky with quick strong jabs! Rocky dodges successful and counterattacks with a strong right hook!
B: Apollo is cut! Rocky landed a strong blow to his right eyebrow and cut him!
A: This is his chance! Rocky quickly throws a left, right, another left! Apollo is getting pounded!
B: Apollo recovers with a powerful hay maker and catches Rocky off guard! He's down! The ref starts the count!
C: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5......
