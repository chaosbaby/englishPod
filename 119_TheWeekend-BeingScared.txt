Shabby: Eddie, why are we at this scary looking mansion? It's like, ultra spooky!
Eddie: I told you already Shabby, the owner of the house says there is a ghost haunting his house so we have to go in and investigate.
Scury puypoo: I don't like this!
Wilma: Come on guys, stop being such cowards. It's a mystery and an adventure!
Shabby: This place gives me the creeps! Seriously guys, let's get out of here! I'm getting goosebumps just being here!
Scruy: Shabby is a scaredy cat!
Wilma: That laugh came from this room. Let's go and check it out.
Eddie: Look! A ghost! Run!
