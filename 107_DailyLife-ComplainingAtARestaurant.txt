A: Excuse me, waiter? Waiter!
B: Yes, sir? What can I do for you?
A: I've been sitting here for the past twenty minutes and no one has offered me a glass of water, brought any bread to the table and our appetizers haven't been served yet! You know, in this kind of establishment, I'd expect much better service.
B: I am sorry, sir. I'll check on your order right away.
C: Relax honey, the place is busy tonight, but I've heard the food is amazing. Anyway...
B: Here you are, sir. The foie gras for the lady, and a mushroom soup for you.
A: Waiter, I ordered a cream of mushroom soup with asparagus. This soup is obviously too runny, and it's over-seasoned. It's completely inedible!
B: Okay, I do apologize for that. Can I bring you another soup, or would you like to order something else?
A: Take this foie gras back as well, it's rubbery and completely overcooked. And look at the portion size! How can you charge twenty-five dollars for a sliver of duck liver?
B: Right away... Sir.
C: Honey come on! The foie gras was fine, why are you making such a big deal? Are you trying to get our meal comped again?
C: What do you mean? We are paying for this, If I'm shelling out my hard earned bucks, I expect value for money!
B: Here you are, sir. I hope it is alright now. The chef has prepared it specially for you.
A: Yes, fine.
C: Honey, are you alright!
