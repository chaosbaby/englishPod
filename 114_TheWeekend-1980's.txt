A: Jim! What's up man!
B: Charlie! Is that you ride? It's butt ugly, dude!
A: Don't be a airhead! This is a nineteen sixty-nine Chevy Impala! I just need to fix it up a bit. In a couple of months, this baby is gonna be wicked!
B: Not even! Check it out! Now that's a fresh ride!
A: Too bad the driver is a major dweeb. Anyone can have a car like that if their daddy is loaded like his.
B: He's coming this way, be cool.
C: Hey guys! What do you think of my automobile? Isn't it bad to the bone?
A: Word! The ladies are gonna be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around in that car.
C: You really think so?
B: For sure!
C: Awesome!
A: Psych! Ha ha ... You totally fell for it.
C: You are a real scumbag, Charlie. When I do the nasty with the prom queen, we'll see who has the last laugh.
B: Dude, don't have a cow!
