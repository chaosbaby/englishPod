A: It smells like ashtray in here!
B: Hi honey! What's wrong? Why do you have that look on your face?
A: What's wrong? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking.
B: No! I said I was going to cut down which is very different. You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight!
A: Look, there are other ways to quit. You can try the nicotine patch, or nicotine chewing gum. We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place. It's not like you can just light up like before.
B: I know, I know. I am trying but, I don't have the willpower to just quit. I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch! Please understand?
A: Fine! I want a divorce!
