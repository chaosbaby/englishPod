A: Hey, Gary, great to see you again. Please have a seat. So tell me, what seems to be the problem?
B: Thanks, doc. I've got a really bad toothache! I can't eat anything, and look, my face is all swollen. I think it might be my wisdom tooth.
A: Well, let's have a look. Open wide. Hmm... This doesn't look good. Well, it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose. We'll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse, and the crown probably needs to be refitted. I'm going to order some x-rays.
B: Is it gonna hurt?
A: No, not at all! Just lay back and relax.
A: OK, spit.
