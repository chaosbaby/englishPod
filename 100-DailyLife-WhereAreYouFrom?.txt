A: Where to, miss?
B: Hi! Crenshaw and Hawthorne, at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner.
A: Sure thing. So, where are you from?
B: From china.
A: Really? You don't look very Chinese to me, if you don't mind me saying so.
B: It's fine. I am actually from Mexico. I was in china on a business trip, visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.
A: Wow sounds interesting! Excuse me if I am bing a bit nosy but, how old are you?
B: Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?
A: Don't get me wrong! It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas!
B: Well thank you! In that case, I am 26 years old, and what about yourself?
A: I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U.S of A, although I have some Colombian heritage.
B: Really? That's great! Do you speak some Spanish?
A: Uh... Yeah..., of course!
B: Que bien! Entonces Podemos hablar en espanol!
