A: So, are we ready to go?
B: Yup, I think so. The car's packed; munchies and music, and the map is in the car.
A: Did you get the camera?
B: Got it! Did you fill up the tank?
A: Yup, it's all set.
B: You're sure we're not forgetting anything?
A: I'm sure... We've got all our bases covered.
B: Well let's get going then! I love road trip!
B: Um... Do you think we can make a pit stop?
A: But we've only been on the road for ten minutes.
B: I Know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.
