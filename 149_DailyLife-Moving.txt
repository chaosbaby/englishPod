A: OK, that's fine. Bye.
B: What happened?
A: That's it, my lease is up. I have to move.
B: What? Why? Can't you renew it?
A: The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot.
B: Well, I can help you back. We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP.
A: I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something. You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here. I'm gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while.
B: Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help out.
A: Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?
B: hehe .. Sure.
