A: ...And now, let's go to Kenny Williams for today's weather forecast.
B: Thank you Bill, and good morning Salt Lake City!
A: What's the weather looking like today, Kenny?
B: Well, it's a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today; we've got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah, we're calling for scattered showers throughout the day, with a day-time high of forty-five degrees. Now, if we move down to the south of the state, we can see that a cold front is moving in. We can expect clear skies, but it will be quite cold, with temperatures hovering around the thirty degree mark.
A: It's a chilly day folks, so don't forget your coats! What about tomorrow Kenny? Do you have good news for us?
B: Well, it'll be a rainy day for Northern Utah; we can expect some isolated downpours in the morning. Winds will be coming in from the North East, with gusts reaching twenty-three miles per hour. Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening. Things are looking a bit better for the South; we'll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers. Later in a day, we can expect partly cloudy skies, with a forecast high of thirty-eight degrees.
A: You heard it folks! It's gonna be a cold one!
B: That's right Bill. We will have more later on today on the six o'clock news. That's the weather forecast for this morning.
