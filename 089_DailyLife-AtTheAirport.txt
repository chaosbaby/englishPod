A: next Please! Hello sir, may I see your passport please?
B: Yes, here you are.
A: Will you be checking any bags.
B: Yes, I'd like to check three pieces.
A: I'm sorry, sir. Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage, at twenty kilograms each, plus one piece of carry-on luggage, I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.
B: What? Why! I am taking an international flight! I'm flying sixteen thousand kms! How am I supposed to only take two, twenty kilo bags? That's absurd!
A: I am sorry, sir, there's nothing I can do. You can not board the flight with that large bag either. Carry-on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat. That bag is clearly too big.
B: Now I see. You charge next to nothing for an international ticket, but when it comes to charging for other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg! So tell me, miss, how much will I have to pay for all of this.
A: Let's see... Six hundred and twenty-five  US dollars.
B: That's more than my round-trip ticket!
