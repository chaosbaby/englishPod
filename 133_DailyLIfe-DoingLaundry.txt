A: OK, let's go through this one more time. I don't want anyone ruined or dyed blouses!
B: I know, I know, OK, so I have to separate the colors from the white and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine.
A: Right, You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you're washing. For example for delicates, you should set a shorter washing cycle. Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing.
B: So complicated! OK, what about this red wine stain? How do I get it out?
A: Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick.
B: Cool. Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it's all set right?
A: No! Since you are washing delicates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes.
B: You know what? I'll have everything dry cleaned.
