A: Wow, you're up early today! What's for breakfast?
B: Well, I felt like baking, so I made some muffins.
A: Smells good! I'll make some coffee. Do you want me to make you some eggs?
B: Sure, I'll take mine, sunny side up.
A: Eww, I don't know how you can eat your eggs like that! Ever since I was small, I've had eggs and soldiers.
B: You know, my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years. It drove my mom crazy!
A: You know what really drives me crazy? When I ask for soft boiled eggs, and they overcook them, so they come out hard boiled! How can you dip you toast into a hard boiled egg?
B: You're so picky sometimes.
A: Here you go, honey, fried eggs.
B: Damn it! I asked sunny side up! How many times do I have tell you.
