A: You should have seen the TV show that was on last night, the topic it covered was really interesting; animal right.
B: Do you really believe in that? If they are going to focus on something, they should do in on civil right.
A: Yes, but we can't deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless, and are completely at the mercy of human beings.
B: I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights. If so much attention weren't devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.
A: You can't compare apples and oranges; I believe that both topics are important and that we can't ignore then, the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance. I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.
B: Well, you are right on that point. This is the reason that I don't buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products.
A: At least you're doing your part. My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.
A: As long as you don't treat it better than you wife, its fine.
