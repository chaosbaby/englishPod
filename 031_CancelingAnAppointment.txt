A: Hello, Samantha speaking.
B: Hi Samantha. This is Angela calling.
A: Oh, hi Angela, what's up?
B: I'm just calling about our meeting today. I wonder, is it possible to reschedule our appointment in the afternoon? I have a bit of an emergence that I have to take care of.
A: Let me see, it shouldn't be too much of a problem...
B: I'm really sorry, I hope it doesn't inconvenience you too much, it's just this thing came up, and ...
A: Angela, you know what, I can't make it to our meeting, either. Why don't we postpone it to tomorrow afternoon at the same time?
B: Sounds great. See you tomorrow.
C: Angela... Angela, look up? See that lady over there who is trying on a red leather jacket? Isn't that Samantha?
B: What? No wonder she told me she couldn't make it to the meeting, oh, no, I think she saw me...
