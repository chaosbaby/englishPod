A: Hello baseball fans, and welcome back to today's game! My name is Rick Fields and of course, I am here, once again, with the man that seals the deal, Bob Copeland.
B: It's a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions.
A: Well, the national anthem has just been sung, and the umpire has started the game. It's time to play ball!
B: Roger Vargas is up at bat. The pitcher winds up and strike one.
A: A very nice curve ball by the pitcher. The catcher gives him the sign, he winds up and Vargas gets the line drive!
B: The players are scrambled to get the ball. Vargas gets the first base and he's still going! The out fielder throws it to the second! Vargas slides! He's safe!
A: Great play!
B: We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okami! There's the pitch, he hits it! It's going, going, that ball is gone!
