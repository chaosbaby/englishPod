A: Wow, that terrible movie is finally over. Next time I'm picking the film, because I don't want to end up seeing a chick flick.
B: Well you should have picked, in the end you always complain about everything.
A: Not everything, just this film. Even the title is ridiculous; and it's long, those are two and a half most wasted hours of my life, so much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back.
B: I'm thinking of taking you back home. I thought we could have a nice evening, but you're always so negative.
A: I'm only complaining a movie that I could rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.
B: You see, that's what I'm talking about, I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore.
A: Next time, go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings.
B: Well he's more of a man than you are; at least he appreciates love stories.
A: Love? More like one-night-stands.
B: Don't criticize Mario or else I'll start on those fat, drunk friends of yours; they're no saints.
A: My friends? Fat? What about those whales you call friends?
B: You're unbearable; you can walk home, I'm leaving.
