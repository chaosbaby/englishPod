A: Hi!  We are the Christianson's! We are here to see the apartment.
B: Oh, hi! Sure, come on in! Well, as you can see, the place has just been renovated. The previous tenants left a huge mess here, so the landlord has redone everything.
A: It looks great. It's so bright and airy! What great light! I really like these hardwood floors. What's the square footage of this place?
B: Well, it's about 120 square meters, or 1300 square feet, more or less. Oh, the landlord has also installed new kitchen appliances. There's a new dishwasher, and a professional-grade gas range. Really, at this price, this place is an amazing deal!
A: I love it! But what are the payment terms?
B: First and last month rent as deposit and rent is due on the 1st of every month. Considering the amount of money invested into the apartment, it's a very good deal!
A: Yes, it is! To good to be true...
B: The living room and dinning room are quite spacious as you can see, and down this hall, here's the master bedroom. It has a huge walk-in closet and an en-suit bathroom. We can't go in there yet as the police... I mean the clean up crew hasn't finished.
A: What do you mean? What's in here?
