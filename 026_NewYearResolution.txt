A: So, did I tell you about my New Year's resolution? I've decided to go on a diet.
B: And you're going to completely transform your eating habits, right?
A: Exactly! I'm going to cut out all the junk I eat; no more chips, no more soda, no more fried food.
B: I've heard this one before.
A: But this time I'm going to stick to it. I really mean it! Trust me, Carol, I'm going to be a new man in one year's time!
B: Well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
A: Thanks, honey, that was a great meal. I'm stuffed. Do we have any chips left?
