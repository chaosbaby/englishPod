A: And so, that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year. Thank you very much for you time.
B: Hey, that was quite the Presentation! Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline. I've gotta say, Alex, you really wowed me today.
A: Aw, come on; it was nothing. I'm just doing my job.
B: No, I think you deserve some recognition here; I mean, if I look back on your previous Presentations, this is a huge improvement.
A: Well, Kristin did give me a hand with the slides. She's a real wiz on Power Point.
B: And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies. I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions.
A: Yeah, well, that was some good advice. You made some really good points.
B: Well, I just wanted to say well done. Really you did a great job.
