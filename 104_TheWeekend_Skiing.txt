A: Welcome ski lover of all ages! My name is Rick Fields and here with me is the man that needs no introduction, Bob Copeland.
B: Thank you, Rick! What a beautiful day here in Aspen, Colorado where the sun is shining, and we've got twelve inches of fresh powder. It doesn't get much better than this.
A: that's right, Bob, but today we have a special treat for our viewers. We're joined here by Ian Roussy, the four-time giant slalom champion. And on this special edition of the show, Ian is going to teach us the basics of skiing! So, let's hit the slopes!
C: Well, first off, let's get those boots on. You're going to want to make sure your boots fit snugly.
C: That's right; now snap them into your bindings.
C: And you're also going to want a good pair of goggles to protect your eyes. It's a bright day today, so there's going to be a lot of glare out there on the slopes. We don't want you hitting any of those moguls!
A: Bob, since you're a beginner skier and might take a few spills, it is a good idea to have a good warm pair of dry ski gloves.
C: Easy there, Rick! Well, let's head on over to the chairlift, and test your skills! All right, we're up here on the bunny hill, so, Bob, why don't you do a few snow-plow turns. Gnarly run, Rick! Nice carving! You've got some mad skills! That was sick!
A: You wanna see gnarley? Well, see that bump over there, I'm going to catch some major air.
C: But plant!
B: Ha ha ha! He lost his skis! Yard sale!!!
A: Ahem, well. Thanks for joining us here today, I think that about does it. Bob, Ian, time for some apres-ski?
C: No way, man! We're off to grab some freshies!!!
