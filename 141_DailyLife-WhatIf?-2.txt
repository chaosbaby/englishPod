A: This is the good life! We have it good don't you think?
B:Yeah of course! Although, don't you ever wonder what "could have been"?
A: What do you mean?
B: Well, sometime I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.
A: For example?
B: Like for example, if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to.
A: I see. Yeah now that now I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and me Sally.
B: You see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago!
A: Well, I have no regrets!
B: I'll drink to that!
