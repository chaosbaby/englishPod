A: Hello. May I help you?
B: Yeah, this dress is really nice! How much is it?
A: That one is one hundred and fifty dollars.
B: One hundred and fifty dollars? What about this other one over here?
A: That's one hundred and forty dollars.
B: Hmm... That's a bit out of my price range. Can you give me a better deal?
A: This is an exclusive design by DaMarco! It's a bargain at that price.
B: Well, I don't know. I think I'll shop around.
A: Okay, okay, how about one hundred dollars?
B: That's still more than I wanted to spend. What if I take both dresses?
A: Okay, I can give you a special discount, just because you seem like a nice person. One hundred and ninety dollars for both.
B: I don't know... It's still a bit pricey... Thanks anyway.
A: Okay, my final price! One hundred dollars for both! That's two for the price of one. That's my last offer!
B: Great! You've got a deal!
