A: This is ridiculous! I can't believe you've been sleeping with someone else! How could you do this! You know what? I'm out of here!
B: Wait! Doctor how is this possible? I haven't cheated on my boyfriend!
C: I have something to confess... I'm sorry Veronica, I lied.
B: Wait... What? What do you mean?
C I lied. You aren't even pregnant; there's no bun in the oven. I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy that I couldn't help myself. Veronica I love you!
B: What are you talking about!!! Who are you?
C: It's me! Daniel, don't you remember me? From high school. I sat behind you every day in class! I used to go to every football game and watch you in the cheerleading squad!
B: You are insane! We never even spoke! Why did you lie like that to my boyfriend?
C: Because Veronica... It's not fair! I love you; I have since the first day we met! Everything was going fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined everything! I went to med school and become a doctor for you! You always said how you wanted to marry a doctor! You will be mine now..., one way or another...
A: I heard everything, you lying bastard! Get your hands off her!
