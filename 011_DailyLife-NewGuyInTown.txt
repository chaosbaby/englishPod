A: Oh, I don't know if you heard, but someone moved into that house down the road.
B: Yeah, I know. I met the owner of the house yesterday as he was moving in. His name is Armand.
A: Really? What's he like? You have to fill me in.
B: Actually, he's a bit of strange. I don't know... I've get a bad feeling about him.
A: Really? Why?
B: Well, yesterday I bought over a housewarming gift, but Armand started acting very weird, and then he practically kicked me out! I tried to, sort of, peek into his house, but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't get a good look.
A: Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning. A deliver trunk pulled into his driveway, and it dropped off a long, rectangular box. It almost looked like a coffin!
B: You see! Why would he...
C: Hello ladies...
B:Ah, Armand! You scared the heck out of me! This is my friend Doris.
C: A pleasure to meet you... If you are not doing anything tonight. I would like to have you both for dinner. I mean... I would like to have you both over for dinner.
