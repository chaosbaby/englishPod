A: Hey man! How's it hanging?
B: Hey man! Everything is just groovy baby!
A: Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday? I heard it was far out, man!
B: I wanted to, but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place.
A: Right on, right on! Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dynamite! He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.
B: Gravy! Jim is such a jive turkey man. He is always hitting me up for cash. Anyway, you wanna book and go grab some grub?
A: Yeah man, I'm starving!
