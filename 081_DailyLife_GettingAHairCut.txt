A: Hello there! Come on in! Don't just stand there! Come and take a seat!
B: Um, okay. Well, I just want a trim. Nothing too fancy.
A: Oh my gosh! Your hair is amazing! So silky, so shiny! I am going to work my magic on your hair! You hear me? You are going to look like a million bucks!
B: Okay. Um... Can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top.
A: Don't you worry, I'll take care of everything! (starts cutting) On my god! I just love your curly hair! It's so fluffy and cute! You should totally let it grow out. An afro would look great on you!
B: Um... No.
A: Okay, but you are going to be my masterpiece!
