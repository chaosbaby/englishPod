A: Nick! How's it going?
B: Oh, hey...
A: What are you doing in this neighbourhood? Do you live around here?
B: Actually, my office is right around the corner.
A: It was great to meet you last week at the conference. I really enjoy our conversation about foreign investment.
B: Yeah, yeah. It was really interesting. You know, I'm in a bit of hurry, but here's my card. We should definitely meet again and continue our discussion.
A: Sure, you still have my contact detail, right?
B: You know what, this is really embarrassing, but your name just slip my mind. Can you remind me?
A: Sure, my name is Anna Ferris. Don't worry about it; it happy to me all the time. I'm terrible about name too.
