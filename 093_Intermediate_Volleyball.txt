A: It's a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men's Volleyball world championship. My name is Rick Fields and I'm joined by the man with the plan, Bob Copeland.
B: Thank you ,Rick. We've got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams, Brazil and China, face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round. Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match.
A: The ref signals the start of the game and here we go. Ribeiro serves and China quickly receives the ball. Chen bumps it to the setter, and ..., a very nice set by Chen!
B: Xu spikes it! Wow, what a great hit! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in! Great play.
A: It's China's service now. What a superb jump serve by Li, oh, and we have a let serve. The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net.
B: Brazil calls for a time out and we'll be right back, after a short commercial break.
