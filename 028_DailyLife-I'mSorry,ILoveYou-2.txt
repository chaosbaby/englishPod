A: I'm so relieved that your ankle wasn't broken! I feel just awful about this whole thing. I wanna make it up to you. Let me take you out to dinner tonight. My treat.
B: That sound great! I'd love to! Here is my address. Pick me up at eight?
A: Perfect!
B: Thank you for such a lovely evening! The food was amazing, and I had a great time.
A: Me too. You look so beautiful tonight! I wish this night would never end. There's something I have to tell you...
B: What is it?
A: I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day, but I was wrong. A twist of fate brought us together. I crashed into your life and you into mine, and his my sound crazy, but I'm falling in love with you.
