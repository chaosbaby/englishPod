A: Mr. Mckenna, do you have a second? I need to talk to you about something.
B: Sure, Liv, what can I do for you?
A: Well, I was just wandering... You see, I know I've used up all my vacation days this year, but my sister is getting married, and the wedding is overseas, and, well...
B: You wanna take some time off, is that right?
A: Well, sir, I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year.
B: What dates are you planning on taking off? I'll need at least two months notice, so that I can plan for your absence.
A: I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth. Would you be okay with that?
B: Well, I guess so.
