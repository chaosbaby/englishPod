A: Whoa,whoa, what's going on? Watch out!
B: Hey, watch where you're going!
A: Oh, no! I'm so sorry! Are you all right?
B: Oh... I don't know.
A: I feel terrible, I really didn't mean to knock you over. My tire, just exploded, and I lost control of my bike.Really, it was an accident. Please accept my apologies.
B: Just let me try to stand up.
SONG: Why do birds suddenly appear, every time you are near?
A: Are you okay?
B: Oh, wait a second, you seem really familiar. I think I know you from somewhere.
A: Yeah, I think we have met somewhere before. That's right! We met at Aaron's place last weekend! What a coincidence! But anyway, I'm glad to see that you're not too badly hurt, and I should probably get going. I have a nine o'clock meeting.
B: Ouch! My ankle! I think it's broken! You can't just leave me like this! Are you calling an ambulance?
A: Nope, I'm canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you.
SONG: Do you remember when we met? That's the day I knew you were my pet. I wanna tell you how much I love you.
