A: All right, people. We're holding this meeting today because we've get to do something about our sales, and we need to do it NOW! I want concrete solutions. How do you intent to drive sales... Roger?
B: Well, in fact, we're the most expensive in the market, so maybe we could lower our price to match our competitors.
A:Lower our price? Not very creative. It'll never fly with the Swan. What kind of thinking is that? Geez. Anybody else have a better plan? Natalie?
C: Um, perhaps, um, a sales promotion.Maybe a two-for-one offer, or something like that.
A: What? That's the same thing. Bad idea. Really bad idea. Dammit people come on! Think! The CEO will be here any minute.
D: Do we have any ideas yet?
C: Yes Mr.Swan, we were kind of considering a two-for-one to get more competitive.
D: A two-for-one promotion? Hmm. I kind of like the sound of that. It sounds like something we should consider.
A: Yeah, exactly. Just what I was thinking! In fact, that's a brilliant idea! I'm glad we thought of that. Very creative.
