A: Thank god you showed up when you did! He's insane! Do you think we should call the police?
B: Don't worry about it, I'll call my friend and have him take care of it. I can't believe he was stalking you all these years. What a nut job!
A: I know! Well... He said I'm not pregnant. I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing. I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose...
B: Don't apologize! From the moment I met you, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm with you again, I'm... I'm just scared, Veronica. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you, I mean, I just can't handle it! We were made for each other, Veronica. You are my everything, my soul mate. What can I do?
A: Just hold me... I'll always be here for you, no matter what. And together, we can tackle whatever life throws at us. I believe in us, Veronica.
B: I'm so happy to hear that! I knew we belong together. I love you so much.
