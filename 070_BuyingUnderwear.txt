A: This sucks; I hate buying lingerie. Okay, just find something and get out of here. Alright, these are fine. Oh, no, don't come over here, don't come over here.
A: You look like a little lost, can I help you?
A: Um, I'm just having a look around. It's my girlfriend's birthday tomorrow. I'm trying to find her something.
B: Well, you can't give her granny panties. Have you thought about getting her some sleepwear? We've  got these lovely, silky nighties. Or, how about a nice pantie and bra set. Look, here's a nice satin push-up bra, and can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it.
A: Sure that's fine.
A: This is so awkward... What one do I pick? What size is she?
B: Well, do you want a thong, some bikini briefs, maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts?
A: Just pick something and get the hell out of here.
A: Um, I'll go with these two.
A: This is mortifying; I just want to get this over with. She better thank me for this...
B: Here you are, sir. I'm sure she'll enjoy them.
A: Finally!
B: I'm sorry, sir. I'm going to have to take a look inside your bag.
