A: Good evening. Pizza House. This is Marty speaking. May I take you order?
B: Um yes... I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives, and extra cheese.
A: We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas. Would you like a large pizza instead?
B: Sure that sound good.
A: Great! Would you like you second pizza to be the same as the first?
B: No, make the second one with ham, pineapple and green peppers. Oh, and make it thin crust.
A: Okay, thin crust. You total is $21.50 and you order will arrive in thirty minutes or it's free!
B: Perfect. Thank you. Bye...
A: Sir, wait! I need your address!
