A: Hello, Arthur. What seems to be the problem?
B: Hey doc. Well, I think I might need glasses. I'm getting headaches, and I really struggle to see things that are far away. But I have always had 20/20 vision.
A: Sounds like you may be far-sighted. OK, then, cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.
B: Mmm... X,E,R,3 a question mark, and I can't quite make out the other symbol but I think it's a peace sign.
A: Wow, Arthur! You're as blind as a bat!
B: Yeah, I know, my vision is very blurry at times.
A: OK then, head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription.
B: Thanks doc!
A: Arthur, that's the bathroom.
