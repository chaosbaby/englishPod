A: Seriously, I don't know why we need to get a new TV.
B: Honey I told you already. I can't appreciate the graphics level and detail of the game on my Playstation 3 on our old TV.
C: Good afternoon folks! How can I be of service today?
B: I'm looking to upgrade to a newer, bigger television set.
C: You've come to the right place! What size are you looking for?
A: Just a normal sized TV for our living room.
C: I see. Well this set is on sale. It's a forty six inch HDTV screen and has all the works. Three HDMI connectors, USB, VGA and S - Video ports. It even has a DVI port so you can hook up you PC or laptop! This is without doubt the complete home theater experience!
B: This is exactly what I need! Can you imagine watching movies or playing video on this thing?
A: Honey, I think it's a bit too big. I don't even think it will fit in our living room.
C: Not to worry, we will deliver and install it in your home. It come with a wall mount so you can just hang it on the wall like a picture.
B: This is great! How much will this set me back?
C: Lucky for you, this is the last one we have in stock so it's half off!
B: I'll take it!
