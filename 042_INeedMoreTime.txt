A: So, Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?
B: Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that. I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.
A: You've had over a month to get this finalized! Why are things delayed?
B: Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems...
A: I'm not looking for excuses here. I just want to get this finished on time!
B: I know, and I apologize for the delay. But some things just beyond my control. I had trouble booking the photographer, and then Micheal was sick for three weeks, so I couldn't include him in the photos, and the design team lost all the files, so I had to redo the pictures.
A: I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey! I want those photos ASAPÔºÅ
