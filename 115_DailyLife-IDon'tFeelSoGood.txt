A: Are you okay, man? You don't look very well.
B: Ugh, I feel terrible. I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.
A: Nice! So, where did you guys go?
B: We hit a couple of local bars, and met up with some friends. Everything was cool until Mike came along, and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday!
A: Oh no! Mike's birthday is a drink fest for sure!
B: Tell me about it! We drank everything in the bar!
A: Is that why you missed work today?
B: Yeah. I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous. I threw up like five times.
A: Eww!
B: I was so dehydrated that I drank a gallon of water, and my head has been pounding all day. I swear, I'm never gonna drink again!
A: Too bad man, tonight is Tracy's going away party and she asked if you were gonna go.
B: Oh, Yeah. I'm there!
