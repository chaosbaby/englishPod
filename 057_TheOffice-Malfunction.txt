A: Hey Carl, can you make a copy of this contract for me please? When you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our subbranch.
B: Sure! Um... I think I broke this thing. Maxine, can you help me out here? I'm not really a tech guy.
C: Yeah, sure. I think it's just out of toner. You can go use the other one upstairs. On your way up, can you fax this while I try and fix this thing?
B: Sure! Damn it! Everything in this office seems to be breaking down! Never mind. I'll send this stupid fax later. Oh great! Is someone playing a practical joke on me? This is ridiculous!
D: The elevator has some sort of malfunction. Just take the stairs dude. What floor are you going to?
B: I have to go up fifteen floors! Never mind. Made it! There is the copier!
