A:Dan, Dan dude. You have to come to my house right now!
B: Is everything OK?
A: Just get over here!
B: Come in! Quickly!
B: So, Since when is your home a bank?
A: What do you mean?
B: I mean, what's up with the locks and iron bars on your windows.
A: Security Dan, security! You can never be to safe you know! A lot of sickos out there. Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed! Had high power telescope and binoculars by his window.
B: What's the matter with you? You are you acting all paranoid?
A: Paranoid? I'm not paranoid! I'm cautious! You see Dan, we have to be on guard at all time! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you! Telemarketers, solicitor, even you bank! They have way too much information! I like to keep everything on a need you know basis.
B: OK, well, what did you want to see me about?
A: You are being watched! Be careful Dan! Be careful!
