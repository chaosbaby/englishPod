A: OK... I'll talk to you later. Bye.
B: Carrie, are you OK? You seem a bit down.
A: I just got off the phone with my boyfriend. He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing. It's so hard to talk to him at times.
B: Maybe it's just that he is stressed out from work or something. He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know.
A: Yeah but, he is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what's bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, he always shuts down and brushes me off.
B: Men are like that you know. They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.
A: I guess you are right. What do you think I should do? He wasn't always this grouchy you know...
B: Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn't work, I say get rid of him and get a new one!
A: You are something else you know that?
