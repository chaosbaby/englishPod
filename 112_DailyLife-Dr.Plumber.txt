A: Good afternoon! Did you call a plumber?
B: Yes, yes I did. Please come in! I'm so glad you came! This old house is falling apart! Come on into the bathroom. See, here, there's water leaking everywhere!
A: I see. Let me have a look. It seems that you toilet is clogged, and that's why it won't flush. Let me just get my plunger. No, that's not working either. I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipes that's causing a blockage. That's what's making you toilet overflow.
B: On, that must because of my four-year-old daughter. She is always flushing things down the toilet. You know how kids are.
A: Yeah, I have a little one myself. Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed. That could be causing water to not drain completely; that might lead to more problems in the future. I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly. I could have it all finished by today if it's urgent.
B: That would be great! Is it expensive?
A: Let's see... I would say about eight hundred dollars.
B: What? That's more than I make in a day and I'm a heart surgeon!
