A: Hello sir, how can I help you?
B: Yes, I need this prescription please.
A: Let's see. Okay, so 50 mg of Prozac, would you prefer this in capsule or tablet?
B: Capsules are fine.
A: Okay, you should take 1 capsule 3 times a day. Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach, and also, don't ever mix it with alcohol.
B: Yes, I know. It's not the first time I'm taking this! Don't worry, I won't overdose!
A: Okay, anything else I can get you?
B: Oh, yes, I almost forgot! Can I also get some eye drops and um, some condoms?
A: sure. Darn condoms aren't registered in our system.
B: Oh, well that's okay, I'll get some later, thanks... Really it's no problem.
A: Just hang on there a sec. Can I get a price check on " Fun Times Ribbed Condoms" please!
