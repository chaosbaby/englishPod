A: Mike! Hey, how are you, man! Long time no see!
B: Hey, Pat! Yeah, I haven't see you for ages! How are you?
A: I'm doing great! It's funny running into your life like this. Just last week I ran into Matt as well.
B: Yeah, How's he doing?
A: He's doing well. We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened.
B: Oh yeah?
A: Well, we were talking about catching up on what we've been doing, talking about work and family, when all of a sudden, Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it! He started freaking out, and screaming...
B: Ha ha, really?
A: Yeah, and the funniest thing was, that he jump on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl. You had to be there! Everyone was staring and laughing... It was hilarious!
