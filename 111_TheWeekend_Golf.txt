A: Good morning golf aficionados! My name is Rick Field, and you guessed it, I am here with my main man, Bob Copeland.
B: Thank you, Rick! As you can see, ladies and gentleman, we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars!
A: Whoa, that's a lot of cash! Let's go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.
B: All right, we're here at the eighth hole. It's a par four, and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid. Although, I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on his very same hole!
A: Tiger Woods is about to tee off, and let's see if he has the same luck as Jack. Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and, he seems to be very nervous.
B: Oh no! Not a good sing at all! It's definitely not his day today. On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par. He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.
A: It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees. He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it.
B: Oh no! A bear! Run, Tiger, run! Somebody call animal control.
