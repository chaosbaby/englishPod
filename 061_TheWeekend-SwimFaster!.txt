A: This is such a beautiful day! Great for sailing!
B: It sure is! The water looks so nice! Anchor the boat for a little while. I'm going to take a dip.
A: Why are you doggy-padding? I taught you how to swim! Do your breast stroke!
B: I get too tired! I'll just backstroke, it's easier!
A: Try kicking your legs more. That's good. Don't go out too far!
B: It's jump in!
A: Kathy! Get back here! I see a shark!
B: Ahhhhh! Help me! Help! Bring the boat closer! The shark is coming straight towards me!
A: It's right under you! Kathy!!!
