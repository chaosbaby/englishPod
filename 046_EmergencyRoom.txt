A: Help! Are you a doctor? My poor little Frankie has stopped breathing! Oh my gosh, Help me! I tried perform CPR, but I just don't know if I could get any air into his lungs! Oh, Frankie!
B: Ellen, get him hooked up to a monitor! Someone page Dr. Howser. Get the patient to hold still, I can't get a pulse! Okay, he's on the monitor. His BP is falling! He's flatting.
A: NOOOOOOOOO! Frankie! Nurse! Do something!
B: Someone get her out of here! Get me the defibrillator. Okay, clear! Again! Clear! Come on! Damn it! I'm not letting you go! Clear! I've got a pulse!
C: Okay, what's happening?
B: The patient is in acute respiratory failure, I think we're going to have to intubate.
C: Alright! Tubes in! Bag him! Someone give him 10 cc's of adrenaline! Lets go, people move, move!
A: Doctor, oh, thank god! How is he?
B: We managed to stabilize Frankie, but he's not out of the woods yet; he's still in critical condition. We're moving him to intensive care, but...
A: Doctor, just do whatever it takes. I just want my little Frankie to be okay. I couldn't imagine life without my little hamster!
